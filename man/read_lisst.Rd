\title{Read LISST data}
\usage{
read_lisst(fl, sn, pl, zscat, yr, out, model)
}
\arguments{
\item{fl}{Path to processed or binary file (e.g., *.DAT for the 
LISST-100(X)).}

\item{sn}{Serial number of the instrument. Optionally, can be omitted when 
reading a LISST-SOP processed file or when out = 'raw' (binary 
files). In this case, instrument model must be supplied to 
argument model.}

\item{pl}{Path length in meters. If not provided the function will assume 
standard path length for the instrument model (with a warning), 
i.e., no path reduction module in use.}

\item{zscat}{Path to ASCII background data file (e.g., *.asc). This is 
         required for processing binary files, with the exception of out 
= 'raw'. It is optional for the LISST-200X, if it is desired to  
         process the binary file with a different zscat than the 
         internaly stored.}

\item{yr}{The year of first measurement in the data file. Only necessary 
for LISST-100(X). If not provided, function will make a best 
guess (with a warning). See details.}

\item{out}{The output format. Valid options are 'raw', 'cor', 'cal', 'vsf', 
'vol' and 'pnc'. See details.}

\item{model}{A character vector of the instrument model (e.g. "200" for 
LISST-200X). For the LISST-100(X), the detector type must be 
included in the name (e.g., "100C" or "100XC"). Ignored if sn is 
provided.}
}
\value{
The function returns an object of class lisst, an S3 Class inheriting from 
classes data.frame and units. Essentially the data is stored as units objects 
in a data.frame, wich stores the ancilary data as attributes. The number of 
columns in the data.frame is model dependent and is always one larger than 
the standard LISST data since date/time in POSIXct format is added to the 
objects.

The attributes are not expected to be manipulated directly, so are only 
briefly described:
\itemize{
  \item type  - The type of data in the lisst object;
  \item linst - Instrument specific data;
  \item lmodl - Model specific data;
  \item lproc - Processing applied to data (including inversion model);
  \item zscat - Background scattering values.
}
}
\description{
Read LISST processed or binary data files.
}
\details{
The function will determine the file type based on its extenssion. Processed 
files created from LISST SOP for the LISST-100(X) have extension .asc and 
for the LISST-200X, extension .csv. Binary files have extension .DAT and .RBN 
for the LISST-100(X) and LISST-200X, respectivelly.

The parameter out determine the level of processing of the returned object. 
For binary files out can be 'raw' for the raw digital counts, 'cor' for the 
corrected digital counts, 'cal' for values in calibrated physical units or 
'vsf' for the volume scattering function. The corrected digital counts are 
the raw counts de-attenuated for the particle \strong{and water} extinction, 
background subtracted and compensated for area deviations from nominal 
values. 'cal' applies the instrument specific calibration constants to 'cor' 
(for all variables). Aditionally, the transmittance and the particle beam 
attenuation are added in 'cal' type lisst objects. The particle volume 
scattering function is the calibrated values normalized by the detector solid
angle, length of the path generating the signal and energy enetering the 
path. If out is not provided, 'vsf' will be returned for a binary file input. 
For processed files, out can be 'vol' for the volume concentration (ppm) or 
'pnc' for the number concentration (1/L/Âµm). If not provided, 'vol' will be 
returned for processed files. As of this version, is not possible to direcly 
retrieve the particle size distribution (PSD) from binary data (inversion 
model not implemented), so 'vol' and 'pnc' can only be selected for processed 
files. Functions \code{lget}, \code{lgetraw}, \code{lgetcor}, \code{lgetcal}, 
\code{lgetvsf}, \code{lgetvol} and \code{lgetpnc} allow to switch between 
types without need to read from disk. 

A column "Time", with date/time in POSIXct format is added to all created 
objects. If yr is missing when reading a LISST-100(X) file, the function will 
'guess' its value, by acessing the file system modification date information. 
The modification date is used to be consistent across platforms, since 
UNIX-type systems do not register creation date. Still, those are expceted to 
be equivalent since the files are not expected to be modified since their 
creation by the LISST instrument (binary) or the LISST-SOP (processed). In 
the case of binary file, the year will be then precise for the year of 
\emph{last} measurement and the function will handle it appropriatly. For a 
processed file the logic will break down in cases that the file is processed 
in a different year than the final measurement. If a guess was not correct 
and the user have the approriate information, is possible to directly alter 
the Time column in the lisst object using standard R tools to handle POSIX 
objects as an alternative to call \code{read_lisst} again.

\examples{
flp <- system.file("extdata", "DN_27_rs.asc", package = "lisst")
flb <- system.file("extdata", "DN_27.DAT", package = "lisst")

# For a unregistered LISST instrument:
model <- "100CX" 
lop <- read_lisst(flp, model = model)
lob <- read_lisst(flb, out = 'raw', model = model)

# If other levels of processing, including VSF, are required, first
# register a LISST instrument:
path  <- system.file("extdata", package = "lisst")
model <- 100
lisst_reg(model, path)

sn    <- 1298
pl    <- 0.05
yr    <- 2018
out   <- 'vol'
zscat <- system.file("extdata", "bg_20180326.asc", package = "lisst")

# For a processed file:
lop <- read_lisst(flp, sn, pl, zscat, yr, out)
lop <- read_lisst(flp, sn, pl, zscat, yr)
lop <- read_lisst(flp, sn, pl, zscat)
lop <- read_lisst(flp, sn, pl)
lop <- read_lisst(flp, sn) # minimum information

# For a binary file:
lob <- read_lisst(flb, sn, pl, zscat, yr, out = 'raw')
lob <- read_lisst(flb, sn, pl, zscat, yr, out = 'cor')
lob <- read_lisst(flb, sn, pl, zscat, yr, out = 'cal')
lob <- read_lisst(flb, sn, pl, zscat, yr)
lob <- read_lisst(flb, sn, pl, zscat)
lob <- read_lisst(flb, sn, zscat = zscat) # minimum information for full capability
